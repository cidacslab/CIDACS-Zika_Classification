## General info
In this directory, we present the code to construct a Classification algorithm for Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS)

The code originated from the project described in the paper [1]. The purpose of this algorithm is to be able to identify cases of CZS automatically based on electronic records, serogy and imaging reports.

## Compilation
We performed our statistical analysis using Python version 3.6.5.  We computer classification evaluation using Jupyter Notebook.
Necessary packages:
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
* [spacy](https://spacy.io)

## Input data

we use the Brazilian electronic records [RESP (Public Health Event Record)](http://www.resp.saude.gov.br) linked with [SINASC (Live Birth Information System)](sinasc.saude.gov.br).
We use results obtained by the classification performed by a group of specialists described in the article [2] for training.

Data from cranial circonferencing standards according to gender and week of development was obtained from [InterGrowth standards](https://intergrowth21.tghn.org)
